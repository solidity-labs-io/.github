# Solidity Labs

Solidity Labs is the leading boutique smart contract development agency.

## About

We build and review smart contract systems on Ethereum and other blockchains. We are a team of experienced engineers and researchers with a track record of delivering secure and reliable systems.

We have successfully built eight greenfield smart contract protocols, with six already live, securing over $1.65b in TVL.

## Open Source

We are committed to contributing to the security of the community and the ecosystem. For governance safety assistance, refer to our [forge proposal simulator](https://github.com/solidity-labs-io/forge-proposal-simulator) tool. See the [security checklist](https://github.com/solidity-labs-io/code-review-checklist) and [security](https://medium.com/@elliotfriedman3/a-security-stack-4aedd8617e8b) [stack](https://medium.com/@elliotfriedman3/a-security-stack-part-2-aaacbbf77346) for a list of items to consider when building a smart contract system.

## Service Offerings

### Governance Safety

Governance can be tough, especially for on-chain organizations whose proposals must go through a lengthy voting and time lock period.

There have been many examples of the call data being incorrect, metamorphic malicious contracts, and damage or losses caused by the unexpected.

Our expert governance proposal review helps to make this category of issues a thing of the past for your organization.

### Security

Smart contract security is incredibly hard.

Every year, organizations spend significant resources to keep their smart contract systems secure, and yet hackers still find a way through.

Our security services help keep your project off the rekt leaderboard.

We provide support throughout the SDLC to create a safe system from architecture to implementation, to the fixes after reviews.

### Architecture

Getting the architecture of a smart contract protocol right decreases the attack surface, and minimizes the chances of security incidents.

With our experienced engineering team, we can help you build a more secure smart contract system.

### Testing

The hardest part about smart contracts is verification. We can help verify the correctness of your project with our testing services.

Each system is different and requires different tools and methodology. We have expertise in formal verification, fuzz, unit, integration, and invariant testing to increase your project's security.
