# Solidity Labs

Solidity Labs is the leading boutique smart contract development agency.

## About

We build and review smart contract systems on Ethereum and other blockchains. We are a team of experienced engineers and researchers with a track record of delivering secure and reliable systems.

We have successfully built eight greenfield smart contract protocols, with six already live, securing over one billion in Total Value Locked.

## Open Source

We are committed to contributing to the security of the community and the ecosystem. See the [forge proposal simulator](https://github.com/solidity-labs-io/forge-proposal-simulator) tool for help with governance safety. See the [security checklist](https://github.com/solidity-labs-io/code-review-checklist) and [security](https://medium.com/@elliotfriedman3/a-security-stack-4aedd8617e8b) [stack](https://medium.com/@elliotfriedman3/a-security-stack-part-2-aaacbbf77346) for a list of items to consider when building a smart contract system.

## Service Offerings

### Governance Safety

Governance can be tough, especially for on-chain organizations whose proposals must go through a lengthy voting and time lock period.

There have been many examples of the call data being incorrect, metamorphic malicious contracts, and damage or losses caused by the unexpected.

Our expert governance proposal review helps to make this category of issues are a thing of the past for your organization.

### Security Reviews

Smart contract security is incredibly hard.

Every year, organizations spend enormous amounts of resources to keep their smart contract systems secure, and yet hackers still find a way through.

Our security reviews help to make sure your system isn't next on the rekt leaderboard.

We provide reviews throughout the SDLC to create a safe system from the architecture to the implementation, to the fixes after reviews.

### Architecture Reviews

Getting the architecture of a smart contract protocol right decreases the attack surface and minimizes the chances of security incidents.

With our experienced engineering team, we can help you with building a secure and efficient smart contract architecture.

### Testing

The hardest part about smart contracts is verification. We can help your project with our testing services.

Each project is different and we have expertise in Formal Verification, Fuzz Testing and many other automated tools to increase the security of your project.
